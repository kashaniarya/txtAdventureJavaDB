# txtAdventureJavaDB

Started out as a basic text-based adventure game 

a Class for different Rooms
a player Class

Now i've added an Item Class
and linked it to a SQL Database using Postgres

Currently you can pick up and drop items as you move from room to room.
When you enter the game, you start in whichever room you last left with the same items you were last holding and the other items where you last left them.

Soon I will add a front-end visual
